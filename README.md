Dogs vs. Cats Classification using SVM
Overview
This project classifies images of dogs and cats using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Images are resized and flattened into vectors before training the SVM model. The dataset used is from the Dogs vs. Cats Kaggle competition.

Key Steps
Data Collection

Used the Dogs vs. Cats dataset (Kaggle).

Data Preprocessing

Resized images to a smaller dimension (e.g., 64Ã—64) using OpenCV.

Flattened each image into a single vector for SVM input.

Train/Test Split

Divided data into training and validation sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% validation).

Feature Scaling

Applied standard scaling (e.g., StandardScaler) to normalize pixel values.

Model Training

Trained an SVM classifier (SVC) with a chosen kernel (e.g., linear or rbf).

Evaluation

Measured performance on the validation set using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Dependencies
Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

OpenCV (cv2)

scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Install dependencies via:

pip install numpy pandas opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Project Structure
Dogs vs cats.ipynb: Main notebook containing code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

data/ (Optional): Folder to store images if you included them in the repo.

README.md: Project documentation (this file).

How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/DogsVsCats_SVM.git
Download the dataset (if not included) from Kaggle.

Place the dataset in a folder named data or update the notebook paths accordingly.

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
(If you have a requirements.txt file; otherwise use the commands above.)

Open the notebook (Dogs vs cats.ipynb) in Jupyter or Google Colab and run all cells.

Results
Achieved approximately XX% accuracy on the validation set.

The confusion matrix and classification report provide detailed performance metrics.

Future Improvements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different kernels (rbf, poly) and regularization parameters (C, gamma).

Feature Extraction: Use a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) for feature extraction before applying SVM.

Data Augmentation: Augment images (rotation, flips, etc.) to improve generalization.
